### Project 1: Customer Churn Model
Customer churn prediction involves identifying customers who are likely to cancel their subscription or stop using a service. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict churn based on various customer attributes.

### Project 2: Intraday Energy Demand Analysis and Prediction (France)
Using annual (2014) historic energy demand and consumption data, the project seeks to find any seasonal patterns in energy demand. The project makes use of Mean Absolute Error as well as Mean Absolute 
Percentage Error as important tools. Seasonality is found on a daily, weekly, and quarterly basis. The reasons are therefore infered from the findings of an in depth dive in to the seasonal 
temperature flactuations in the country. The outcomes of this project can give rise to a lot of energy saving, energy pricing per unit and also potential energy shortage mitigation measures, should the
need arise.

### Project 3: Deployed Machine Learning Based Card Holder Segmentation System
The project begins with meticulous data preparation, followed by an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover underlying patterns and 
relationships. Employing a Random Forest classifier with carefully tuned hyperparameters, the project demonstrates 
how quality data is more instrumental than complex models when it comes to predictive accuracy. A comparative analysis of models, 
including learning curve assessments, reveals the intricacies of overfitting and the importance of feature selection. The 
culmination of this project is the deployment of the most effective model in a Flask-based web application, showcasing 
real-time customer segmentation.
