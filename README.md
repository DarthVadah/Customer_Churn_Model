### [Project 1: Customer Churn Prediction Model Using a Neural Network Model](https://github.com/DarthVadah/Customer-Churn-Prediction-Model-Using-a-Neural-Network-Model)
This project was conducted in collaboration with a bank in Cyprus which has also key branches in 
Germany, Spain and France, to predict customer churn. The analysis involved using key libraries such 
as TensorFlow and Keras for building machine learning models, as well as Pandas and Seaborn for 
data manipulation and visualization. The final model achieved an accuracy of 87%. Key steps 
included data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, training, dataset 
balancing, and hyperparameter tuning. The insights derived from this analysis aim to help the bank in 
identifying customers likely to churn, thereby informing strategies to improve customer retention.
A summary of the findings can be seen in the images below:

### [Project 2: Intraday Energy Demand Analysis and Prediction (France)](https://github.com/DarthVadah/France-Intraday-Energy-Demand-Analysis-and-Forecasting)
Using annual (2014) historic energy demand and consumption data, the project seeks to find any seasonal patterns in energy demand. The project makes use of Mean Absolute Error as well as Mean Absolute 
Percentage Error as important tools. Seasonality is found on a daily, weekly, and quarterly basis. The reasons are therefore infered from the findings of an in depth dive in to the seasonal 
temperature flactuations in the country. The outcomes of this project can give rise to a lot of energy saving, energy pricing per unit and also potential energy shortage mitigation measures, should the
need arise.

### [Project 3: Deployed Machine Learning Based Card Holder Segmentation System](https://github.com/DarthVadah/Deployed-Machine-Learning-Based-Card-Holder-Segmentation-System)
The project begins with meticulous data preparation, followed by an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover underlying patterns and 
relationships. Employing a Random Forest classifier with carefully tuned hyperparameters, the project demonstrates how quality data is more instrumental than complex models when it comes to predictive accuracy. A comparative analysis of models, including learning curve assessments, reveals the intricacies of overfitting and the importance of feature selection. 
The 
culmination of this project is the deployment of the most effective model in a Flask-based web application, showcasing 
real-time customer segmentation.
